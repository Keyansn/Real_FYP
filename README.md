This is my final year project.

Brief:
Graphs consisting of nodes connected by vertices are important for representing and analysing many important network data sets. These include communications networks, social networks, the connectivity of the brain, and food webs in ecology. These networks are difficult to visualise in 2D, or in 3D projections onto a 2D screen. The aim of this project is to explore virtual reality techniques for visualising different networks.

It will make use of either an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift, and will make use of the Unity framework for programming an interactive VR environment.
